Hello :wave:, welcome to my GitHub pages site. 

I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience. When it comes to languages, for the most part I've worked with Java, but for the past year I've been working with Typescript/Node.js. Professionally, I've worked mostly on backend projects (except for one legacy UI written in Flash!), so recently in my spare time I have been trying out creating UIs using React. I've also been working on self-hosting a website.
